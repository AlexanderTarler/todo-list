This is a simple todo-list that I built using Next.js. The user can add a new task, edit it and delete it. 
The design is made to be easy on the eyes while keeping the important elements highlighted.

# Using This App

1. Clone this repo to your machine.
2. Run 'npm install'.
3. Run 'npm run start'.

4. If a browser does not open up a page automatically, go to:

http://localhost:3000/

# Testing

Run 'npm run test' to start an e2e-test using cypress.
If you want to view the process, run 'npx cypress open' instead.
